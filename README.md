# Object-based reinforcement learning using set networks

This is the code for the experiments in our paper ["Learning to Play General Video-Games via an Object Embedding Network"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05262) (to appear in IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games 2018). A more comprehensive version can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/EndingCredits/Neural-Episodic-Control).

To run the experiments (after installing all dependencies):
```bash
python run_experiments.py
```

## Dependencies
